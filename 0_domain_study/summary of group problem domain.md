# ✅ Milestone 1: Problem Identification  

**Project Title:** *Predicting Post-Transfer Performance of Football
Players from Lower to Top-Tier Leagues*

## 🧠 1. Understanding the Problem Domain (with Systems Thinking)

In professional football, **recruiting the right player at the right time** can
make or break a team’s season. Top-tier clubs such as those in the **Premier
League, La Liga, or Bundesliga** regularly scout players from **lower-tier leagues**
 like the **Eredivisie or Championship**, hoping to find breakout stars.

But despite millions spent on transfers, some players underperform. This makes
 scouting risky, and clubs often ask:

> *"Can we better predict how well a player from a smaller league will adapt and
> succeed at a higher level?"*

Our project focuses on this critical transition: **from lower-tier leagues to
 elite-level football**, and **which individual player attributes**
 (e.g., height, age, speed, experience) are **strongest at predicting success**.

Using **systems thinking**, we view the player’s transfer as a change in the
 environment. Key components of the system include:

- **Input Factors:** Player’s physical stats, performance history, league background.
- **Transformation:** New league conditions – higher competition, intensity, tactics.
- **Outputs:** Post-transfer success (goals, assists, match ratings, minutes played).
- **Feedback Loops:** Performance influences playing time, fan expectations,
   market value.

|---------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| **Abdul Qader** | Football Analytics             | "High-fee transfers often fail to justify their price tags—what attributes *actually* predict success?" |  
| **Hamid**      | Football Statistics            | "xG and possession stats dominate analysis, but physical adaption matters too." |  
| **Khusro**     | Sports Strategy                | "Substitution timing changes games—could player attributes affect adaptation speed?" |  
| **Tibyan**     | Behavioral Analysis            | "Crowd bias exists—does player physique influence referee decisions in new leagues?" |  
| **Saeed**      | Sports Medicine & Data         | "Injury risk models exist, but not for *transitioning* players between leagues." |

### ❓ Research Question  

> **Which individual attributes—such as height, pace, age, or previous league
> experience—most strongly predict a player's successful performance after
> moving from a lower-tier league (e.g., Eredivisie) to a top-tier league
> (e.g., Premier League)?**
---
This question is **actionable, measurable, and relevant** to stakeholders in football

### 💡 Why This Question?

1. **Solves a Real Problem**  
2. **Unique Angle**  
   > This is not just about talent — it’s about **transition readiness**, blending:
   - 📊 *Performance stats*
   - 🧬 *Physical traits*
   - 🎓 *Experience/age*

## 📝 6. Summary

This project takes a real-world football question—**what makes a transfer
 succeed?**—and applies a **data-driven, human-centered approach** to answering
  it. We’re not only learning about modeling, but also building insights that
   clubs, analysts, and fans might genuinely use.

Our team is excited to explore this question further in the coming milestones!
