# Data Strikers ⚽🏆

Welcome to **Data Strikers** , a collaborative research initiative that explores
football through the lens of data science. Our mission is to build reproducible,
insight‑rich projects that illuminate how the beautiful game really works—from
the factors behind an individual’s scoring prowess to the subtle dynamics of
match officiating and injury risk. This repository collects our code, data
workflows, and findings so that students, practitioners, and fans can learn
from—and build upon—our work.

## 📋 Project Milestones

## ✅ Half-Time Report: Milestones Conquered

### Milestone 0: The Kick-Off - Cross-Cultural Collaboration!🌍🤝

Our journey began by uniting as the Data Strikers! This foundational milestone
was all about getting to know each other, agreeing on our collaboration and
communication rules, and defining our project's initial constraints.

framework*

### Milestone 1: Scouting for Gold - Problem Identification 🔍

And so our Mission Begins!

In this phase, we took a deep dive into the world of football transfers, exploring
potential research directions through dynamic team discussions and critical thinking.
After thoughtful analysis and collaboration, we locked in a focused, high impact
research question — the foundation of our entire project!

Want to see how our ideas evolved? Check out our brainstorming journey in the
[Brainstorming Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GjkHdTqSOaXvgHSFjAw1yVrvjhfK8PqvNB8PJSDNICs/edit?usp=sharing),
 and explore the final output that shaped our direction in the milestone

### 📌 Problem Statement

In the highly competitive and financially driven world of professional football,
clubs often invest heavily in players transitioning from lower-tier leagues to
top-tier leagues. However, there's a significant degree of uncertainty regarding
whether these players will successfully adapt and perform at the higher level.
This lack of predictive insight can lead to suboptimal transfer decisions, wasted
resources, and underperforming squads. Our project seeks to address this challenge
by providing a data-driven framework to identify the key individual attributes
that are most indicative of a player's successful adaptation and performance in
a more demanding league environment.

### 🎯 Our Million-Dollar Actionable Research Question

**Which individual attributes—such as height, pace, age, or previous league experience—most
strongly predict a player's successful performance after moving from a lower-tier
league (e.g., Eredivisie) to a top-tier league (e.g., Premier League)?**

## ⏳ The Second Half: Milestones Awaiting

### Milestone 2: Filling the Trophy Cabinet - Data Collection📊

### Milestone 3: Breaking Down the Opposition - Data Analysis📈

### Milestone 4: Celebrating the Win - Communicating Results📣

### Milestone 5: The Grand Final - Final Presentation🏆
