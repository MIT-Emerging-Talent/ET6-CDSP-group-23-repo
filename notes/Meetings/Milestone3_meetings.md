# Milestone 3 Meetings Summaries

## Weekly Check-In Summary - 05/07/2025📝

**Time:** 10:00–11:00 AM ET  
**Attendees:** Tibyan, Khusro, Saeed, AbdulQadr

### Key Points discussed

* Hamid will take care of scraping the remaining player stats for our dataset if
he’s available. If not, he should let us know ASAP so someone else can take over
and keep things moving.✅

* For our analysis strategy, we should decide when comparing average ratings,
do we do it per season or combine them across seasons?✅

* We need to plan for a mid-week meeting, preferably after scraping is done,
so we can start working on data analysis and task distribution efficiently.📅

* We need to schedule a meeting with Evan to discuss two important points:

1) For labeling our data, can we use average ratings from websites like
Transfermarkt or WhoScored? Or do we need to calculate them manually? That would
take a lot more time. Also, can we define our own threshold instead?
2) The reproducibility of our transfer dataset since AbdulQadr collected it
manually — how should we handle that?

* We must start putting internal deadlines for our tasks.📆

* Quick reminder to be more active on Slack! Not everything needs to wait for
a meeting, discussing on Slack can help us move faster and stay on track.⚠️
