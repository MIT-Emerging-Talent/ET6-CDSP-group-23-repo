# Milestone 2 Meetings Summaries

## Weekly Check In Summary - 21/06/2025📝

**Time:** 10:00–11:00 AM ET  
**Attendees:** All

### Key Points discussed

* Modeling our research domain is going to be our priority before gathering the
data. For now, we will stick to talents moving up from the Championship
(2nd tier of English football) and Eredivisie (Dutch League) to the Premier
League (English 1st tier football league).✅
* We need to get leads from transfermarket.com on how many transfers happend from
2018 to 2023 from the mentioned league to the Premier League and if we have
enough data, we can stick with this modeling, if not then we can add some more
lower leagues that generate wonder kids such us South American league,
Portuguese or Turkish league.✅
* Our measurement metrics for player success will be their individual stats across
two seasons, and they will differ based on their playing position. For example,
for a defender, we will have different success measurement metrics than an
attacker or a midfielder.✅
* We will need a Python script to scrape data from
Fotmob.com for players' individual stats.✅

* In addition to the points mentioned above, we will have an extra check-in session
in the upcoming week to discuss the data gathering process and talk more about
the deliverables of this milestone.✅

### Tasks Division

* @Abdul Qader Dost will try to get data
from transfermarket.com as mentioned in point number 2.✅
* @Hamid is in charge of writing a script to scrape players' individual stats from
fotmob.com.✅
* @Saeed Ali, @Khusro Sakhi, and @Tibyan Bilal will be in charge of gathering
research, references, and data to answer the following questions:

1) Are the
Championship and Eredivisie the top two talent exporters to the English Premier League?✅
2) What are the success metrics for a defender?What are the success metrics for
a midfielder?
What are the success metrics for an attacker?
3) Why is Fotmob.com a reliable and
credible source for our domain and research question?
