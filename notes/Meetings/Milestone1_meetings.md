Attendees: All

### Key Points discussed

* We discussed the domain of our research project, and most of the team members
agreed that we should stick to Football as our main domain.✅⚽

* Abdul Qader synced the main branch of our group's repository with the root
repository and pulled all the changes. Hamid was able to review and merge the pull
request successfully, so please feel free to pull the changes on your local device.✅

* Our next weekly check-in meeting will take place on 14th June, at 10AM EST.✅

Your research question needs to be nominated by today or tomorrow latest.✅

* After the research question is decided, we need to do background research and
gather as much information about the research question and domain as we can,
and put it in the readme of the domain_study folder.✅

## Weekly Check In Summary - 14/06/2025📝

Time: 10:00–11:00 AM ET  
Attendees: Saeed, Hamid

### Key-Points discussed

* We discussed the problem statements that we put in our brainstorming document.✅

* Based on our research and internet browsing, we found out that there are multiple
similar case studies for all proposed problem statements except Abdul Qader's
problem statement.✅

* Saeed and Hamid also browsed Kaggle for relevant datasets for Abdul Qader's problem
set, and it appears that we can get relevant data from Kaggle. In addition to
Kaggle, we found out that it is easy and permissible to scrape data from FotMob,
which is a very big and up-to-date Football stats and news application.✅

* The next step would be to do a poll and see if everyone agrees to move on with
Abdul Qader's problem statement and revise, polish, and maybe rephrase it to an
actionable research question.✅

* In addition to the points mentioned above, we discussed and thought that it
would be best for each of us to divide the deliverable points.✅
