# 🎯 Constraints – The Ground Rules for Our Game Plan ⚽

> _“Great teams aren’t great because they’re perfect. They’re great because they

Before we kick off our project like pros, let’s talk about the real stuff —
the limits we might face along the way. Think of this as our **offside line**:
it keeps us in check, but also helps us play smarter, not harder.
While we're dreaming big with **Data Strikers**, we're also grounded in reality.
Our team comes from diverse backgrounds, time zones, and commitments — and that’s
exactly what makes us stronger, more creative, and more resourceful.

Here's a summary of the constraints that shape how we work and what we can deliver.

---

## 🌍 External Constraints

### Things we can’t control but must work around

- 📚 University exams across multiple members — academic life is in full swing!
- 🌐 Occasional internet issues (life of a remote team!)
- 🏠 Family responsibilities and surprise interruptions
- ⏰ Clashing deadlines with other academic or work deliverables
- 🌎 Time zone differences affecting synchronous work
- 🔧 Limited access to certain tools/resources outside working hours

---

## 💼 Internal Constraints – Involuntary

### Things within us that are not always under our control

- 🛠️ Ongoing commitments to other projects
- 📉 Skill gaps in some tools (but hey, we’re fast learners!)
- 📆 Changing availability based on fluctuating workloads
- 🤹 Different levels of experience with GitHub and online collaboration
- 🤔 Diverse perspectives — sometimes leading to discussions (a strength, really!)
- 🛑 Sometimes real life interrupts coding marathons (and that’s okay)

## 🚀 Internal Constraints – Voluntary

### Choices we’ve made to work smarter and healthier

- 🧘 Balancing project work with well-being and life
- 📖 Choosing to learn tools/tech the right way vs. rushing through
- 🕒 Norm of waiting 5 minutes for late arrivals before starting meetings
- ✅ Commitment to writing clean, quality code over quick hacks
- 📲 Checking Slack regularly to stay in sync with updates

---

## 💡 Final Thoughts: Constraints = Creativity Boosters

Rather than obstacles, we see constraints as **creative boundaries**  
that help us focus on what's essential. They push us to:

- Prioritize smartly
- Plan realistically
- Support each other’s pace
- Celebrate progress, not perfection

So if you ever see us working asynchronously, taking our time to learn,
or pausing to breathe — that’s just our secret formula for delivering
something meaningful and sustainable. 💪

Let’s go, **Data Strikers**! 💥
