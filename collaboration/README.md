## Team Norms & Collaboration Guide

“Precision in Analysis, Teamwork in Play”

We are Data Strikers — a team of passionate data science learners brought together
by our shared enthusiasm for sports analytics, particularly football.
Our collaboration is built on trust, communication, and the drive to turn real-world
problems into data-driven insights.
This guide outlines the norms we collectively follow to ensure a supportive,
productive, and inclusive team environment.

## 🌟 Core Values

🌍 Respect & Inclusion: Every voice matters. We create a safe and open environment
for diverse ideas, mental health concerns, and personal challenges.

🤝 Trust & Accountability: We show up for each other, follow through on our
commitments, and own our responsibilities.

🔍 Transparency: We share our work early and often, keep communication open, and
document everything clearly.

🌱 Growth-Oriented: We value feedback, rotate leadership, and actively teach and
learn from each other.

## 📋 Group Norms

Divide tasks based on strengths and interests, but rotate roles to ensure
learning and fairness.

Communicate early if you’ll miss a deadline or need help.

Take initiative — don’t wait to be told what to do.

### 🧠 Learning & Leadership

Rotate leadership for tasks or meetings so everyone practices leading.

Share learnings from courses, projects, and personal insights (e.g. 6.001x, 6.002x).

Embrace feedback with a growth mindset — it’s for improvement, not criticism.

### 🛠 Conflict & Decision-Making

Disagreements? Talk it out respectfully as a group.

Major decisions are made by group voting.

Keep it professional, constructive, and focused on solutions.
