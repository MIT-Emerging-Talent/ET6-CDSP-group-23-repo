# 📚 Learning Goals

Welcome to our project!

Before diving deep, we all agreed it’s important to align on what we hope to
learn, both as a team and as individuals. This project is more than just building
something, it's a chance to grow our skills, learn from each other, and become
 better collaborators and problem-solvers.

## 🌱 General Summary

This project is centered around practicing the full research cycle:  
Finding a real-world problem (with no or poor solutions), asking the right
questions, collecting and preparing data, analyzing it, and finally presenting
our findings clearly and effectively. We’re working together using GitHub,
Slack, and Google Meet — learning how to communicate, manage tasks, and build
hings as a team.

We’re also applying what we’ve learned in 6.001x, 6.002x, and the Foundations
track (from programming and data structures to teamwork and communication) in
real project conditions.
