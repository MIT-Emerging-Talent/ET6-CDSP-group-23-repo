# 🧠 Retrospective: Milestone 1 – Problem Identification

## ✅ What went well

- The team collaborated efficiently during our weekly check-ins and shared multiple
potential problem ideas.
- We selected a relevant and feasible problem (finding football players based on
availability and location) that reflects real-life experience and has available data.
- Everyone participated in evaluating the ideas, especially focusing on originality,
feasibility, and data availability.
- Communication was clear, and we used GitHub and shared documents effectively to
sync progress.

## ⚠️ What didn’t go well

- Initially, we had too many ideas, which delayed the final decision-making process.
- We were slightly late in finalizing the domain summary and distributing writing
tasks.

## 📚 What we learned

- Real-life experience is a strong foundation for identifying practical, research-worthy
problems.
- Weekly meetings are crucial for staying aligned and keeping momentum.
- It's helpful to identify dataset availability early when brainstorming problem
ideas.

## 🔄 What we’ll do differently next time

- Set earlier deadlines internally for decision-making and task assignments.
- Use a simple voting or ranking method to narrow down multiple ideas quickly.

## 📝 Action Items

- Keep up with weekly structured check-ins.
- Use GitHub Issues to break work into smaller tasks earlier.
