# 🌍 Retrospective: Kick-Off & Cross-Cultural Collaboration

## 🧠 Overview

This retrospective reflects on our first group meeting (Kick-Off on 31/05/2025)
and how we approached the foundations of cross-cultural collaboration. The meeting
set the tone for teamwork, communication, and coordination across different time
zones and backgrounds.

---

## ✅ What went well

- Everyone showed up and actively participated, which built a positive team spirit
from the start.
- We successfully set up our collaboration framework early, including:
  - Weekly check-in time (Saturdays, 10 AM EST)
  - Communication channel (Slack)
  - Task management system (GitHub Issues + Project Board)
  - Initial GitHub structure and PR template
- The mood was supportive, enthusiastic, and inclusive — starting off with a clear
team identity: **Data Strikers** ⚽🔥
- Everyone took ownership of their initial responsibilities in the collaboration
folder.

---

## ⚠️ What didn’t go well

- Some members were not fully familiar with GitHub collaboration features, such
as Issues and PR templates — some quick guidance was needed after the call.
- Time zone coordination required clarification; we’ll need to double-check
future meeting conversions for everyone’s region.

---

## 📚 What we learned

- Having a clear communication channel and predefined expectations improves remote
collaboration.
- Setting up structure early (branch rules, templates, weekly syncs) saves time
and confusion later.
- Cross-cultural collaboration thrives when all voices are heard and celebrated
— even small things like naming the team together built camaraderie.

---

## 🔄 What we’ll do differently

- Provide brief onboarding materials for GitHub project board usage (especially
for those newer to Git workflows).
- Consider rotating meeting times or using tools like Doodle to ensure consistent
attendance across time zones, if necessary.

---

## 📝 Action Items

- ✅ Everyone completes their designated collaboration documents.
- 📌 Keep Slack active and use it for async help/questions.
- 📌 Ensure GitHub Project Board remains updated with progress.
- 📌 Keep nurturing team identity and motivation — Go **Data Strikers**! 💪⚽
