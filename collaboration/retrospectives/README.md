## üìå Milestone 1: Problem Identification

During this milestone, our group focused on identifying a meaningful problem grounded
in personal experience and aligned with available data. Our weekly check-ins helped
us evaluate multiple ideas, agree on a promising domain, and begin early planning
for research and documentation.

Highlights from this milestone include:

- Strong collaboration and idea sharing.
- Selection of a well-defined problem from Abdul Qader, backed by real experience
and public datasets.
- Clear division of tasks and effective communication using shared GitHub and
communication plans.
