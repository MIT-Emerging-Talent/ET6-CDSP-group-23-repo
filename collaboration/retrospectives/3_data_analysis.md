# 🔄 Project Retrospective

> “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and
abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”

## ✅ Overview

Up to this point, we’ve:

- Formulated our research question
- Established communication and collaboration norms
- Set up planning and development strategies
- Collected and explored our initial datasets
- Utilized a ML model for our data analysis

This retrospective reflects on what went well, what didn’t, what we adjusted
along the way, and what we’re carrying forward as we move into the next phase:
**Communication Strategy**.

This isn’t about blame, just honest reflection to help us work better as a team
going forward.

## 🔍 Strategy vs. Reality

A quick check on how our initial plans compared to how things actually went:

### ✔️ What went as expected

- Finished properly cleaning our datasets.
- Succefully established a sucess metrics for labeling our datasets.
- Chose aproperiate ML model for our prediction.

### ⚠️ What didn’t go as planned

- Data collection and cleaning weren't done by the previous milestone so it took
us a week to continue scraping the data and 2 weeks to clean it, leaving us short
in time with data analysis.
- One teammate had unexpected obligations, so we reshuffled roles. It wasn’t
planned, but we adapted smoothly.
- Two teammates had Summer semester exams.
- Due to tasks being dependent on each others, if one teammate had unexpected
delay the others get affected as well.

### ➕ What we added

- Added internal deadlines for each task, which made the job a bit faster.
- Divided tasks based on each team member’s **availability and strengths**.

### ➖ What we removed or skipped

- We didn't have time to try more than 1 ML model for analysis.
- We didn't stick properly to the inernal deadlines.
- We didn't plan for extra time in case.

## ✋ Stop Doing

- Setting internal deadlines too close to the actual project deadline, it leaves
little room for review or unexpected delays.
- Assuming full availability from everyone. Life happens, we should always build
in some flexibility.

---

## ✅ Continue Doing

- Weekly meetings and check-ins → kept us aligned and motivated
- Sharing the workload evenly → avoided burnout and helped maintain quality
- Being respectful and flexible when someone needed help or extra time → strong
team culture, no stress

---

## ➕ Start Doing

- Stick to the internal deadlines.
- Proactively discuss everyone's availability at the start and adjust the plan accordingly.
- Maybe use a simple progress tracker (like a shared checklist or dashboard) for
better visibility.
- Being more active in Slack.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Great teamwork is about communication and adaptability, not just doing your
part, but being aware of the team’s rhythm.
- Diversity in skill sets, backgrounds, and perspectives is a strength, it just
takes patience and open-mindedness.
- **Communication is everything** — regular check-ins and honest updates helped
avoid confusion or duplication
- **Adaptability matters** — plans changed, and that’s okay. We adjusted without
drama.
