# 🔄 Milestone Retrospective — Dataset Collection & Preparation

> “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and
abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”  
> — *Norm Kerth*

## ✅ Overview

Even though we’re still early in the research process, we’ve already learned a
lot—both technically and as a team. Up to this point, we’ve:

- Formulated our research question
- Established communication and collaboration norms
- Set up planning and development strategies
- Collected and explored our initial datasets

This retrospective reflects on what went well, what didn’t, what we adjusted
along the way, and what we’re carrying forward as we move into the next phase: **analysis**.

This isn’t about blame, just honest reflection to help us work better as a team
going forward.

## 🔍 Strategy vs. Reality

### ✔️ What Went As Expected

- Explored whether any ready-to-use datasets already existed
- Clearly defined what makes a player “successful” vs. “unsuccessful”  
  (based on minutes played and ratings relative to others in the same position)
- Cleaned and pre-processed the data for our use case
- Explored our collected data to understand trends, missing values, and limitations

### ⚠️ What Didn’t Go As Planned

- There were **no suitable ready-made datasets** for our specific use case  
- Data was **incomplete or unavailable** for some lower-tier leagues and older
seasons (especially before 2016–17)
- Some player data was inconsistent or not standardized across platforms

---

## ➕ What We Added

- Scraped transfer data from **Transfermarkt** and player performance data from
**Fotmob** to build our own datasets
- Adjusted the time range to focus on **seasons with richer, more consistent data**
- Divided tasks based on each team member’s **availability and strengths**
- Kept a shared doc to log issues, blockers, and progress across datasets

---

## ➖ What We Removed or Skipped

- Initially didn’t allocate buffer time, this led to a bit of a rush toward the end
  → **Lesson learned**: build buffer time into our future schedules  
- Skipped goalkeepers to narrow the scope and focus on outfield players (where
data is more complete)
- **Excluded loaned players after the transfer**, to keep our dataset consistent
and focused on **full-time Premier League transfers**, since loan players often
have inconsistent playing time, unclear future paths, or incomplete post-transfer
data

---

## ✋ Stop Doing

- Setting internal deadlines **too close** to the actual deadline, left no
breathing room for review or setbacks
- Assuming everyone will always be fully available, unexpected things came up
(as they do!)

---

## ✅ Continue Doing

- Weekly meetings and check-ins → kept us aligned and motivated
- Sharing the workload evenly → avoided burnout and helped maintain quality
- Being respectful and flexible when someone needed help or extra time → strong
team culture, no stress

---

## ➕ Start Doing

- Set **internal deadlines 2–3 days before** the real ones to allow for
last-minute fixes and reviews
- Discuss and document everyone’s availability at the **start of the phase** to
better plan around other commitments

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- **Communication is everything** — regular check-ins and honest updates helped
avoid confusion or duplication
- **Adaptability matters** — plans changed, and that’s okay. We adjusted without
drama.
- **Diverse perspectives make the work better** — different backgrounds brought
unique insights (and great questions)
- **Calm > chaos** — even when data scraping got messy, we stayed grounded and
kept moving
