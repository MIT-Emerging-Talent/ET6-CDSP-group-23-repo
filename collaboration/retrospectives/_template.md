# 🔄 Project Retrospective

> “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and
abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”

## ✅ Overview

Even at this early stage, it’s important to pause and reflect. So far, our team
has been focused on laying the groundwork, setting up our communication tools,
collaboration norms, development strategy, and other key planning documents.
This retrospective highlights what worked well and what we can improve as we
move into the actual research and development phases.

The goal isn’t to blame anyone or point fingers. Instead, we focus on actions and
patterns that we can change or repeat going forward.

## 🔍 Strategy vs. Reality

A quick check on how our initial plans compared to how things actually went:

### ✔️ What went as expected

- Successfully created and aligned on team collaboration documents (Group Norms,
Communication Plan, Constraints, Learning goals, etc).
- Chose appropriate tools for communication and task management.
- Weekly check-ins and GitHub issues helped keep us organized and accountable.

### ⚠️ What didn’t go as planned

- One teammate had unexpected obligations, so we reshuffled roles. It wasn’t
planned, but we adapted smoothly.
- Internal deadlines were sometimes set too close to the final deadline, leaving
us rushed near the end.

### ➕ What we added

- Reassigned tasks mid-project when someone needed support, flexibility kept us
on track.

### ➖ What we removed or skipped

- Initially didn’t plan for buffer time. We realized this late and had to rush a
bit. Next time, we’ll build it into our schedule from the start.

## ✋ Stop Doing

- Setting internal deadlines too close to the actual project deadline, it leaves
little room for review or unexpected delays.
- Assuming full availability from everyone. Life happens, we should always build
in some flexibility.

---

## ✅ Continue Doing

- Weekly meetings and regular check-ins, these kept everyone aligned and helped
us catch blockers early.
- Sharing workload fairly and checking in with teammates, made the process
smooth and fair.
- Maintaining a respectful and supportive team vibe ,when someone needed help,
we adapted with understanding and no drama.

---

## ➕ Start Doing

- Set internal deadlines a couple of days ahead of the real ones for extra
breathing room.
- Proactively discuss everyone's availability at the start and adjust the plan accordingly.
- Maybe use a simple progress tracker (like a shared checklist or dashboard) for
better visibility.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Great teamwork is about communication and adaptability, not just doing your
part, but being aware of the team’s rhythm.
- Diversity in skill sets, backgrounds, and perspectives is a strength, it just
takes patience and open-mindedness.
- A calm, flexible attitude helped us adjust without conflict when plans changed.
